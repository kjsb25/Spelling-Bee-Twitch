# Spelling Bee Clone with Twitch Integration

Very WIP. Meant to be able to run in a twitch chat, have a NYT styled Spelling Bee that users can play with a !sb command, and keeps thier score

## Future Features 

### Mandatory
- Pull from current NYT Spelling Bee Wordlist
- Play Locally
- Scoreboard (for local and twitch chatters)
	* Score Permanence

### Stretch Goals
- Command to check score (at any time)
- Export game to NYT (essentially game in speed mode)
